<p>For those that hadn’t already seen it, Air Mozilla is in the process of switching over to a new platform.  They’ve already discontinued posting new content on the old platform, and the new platform doesn’t have anonymous access available yet (but it’s coming at the end of June).  This means the old URL for watching our meetings live isn’t going to work this month.  Fortunately, public meetings on the new platform are mirrored to Youtube, so you’ll be able to watch it at <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7OC8CXMGyo">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7OC8CXMGyo</a></p> <p>Of course, if you want to participate instead of just watch, feel free to join us using one of the methods on <a href="https://wiki.mozilla.org/Bugzilla:Meetings">the wiki</a>.</p> <p>Today’s meeting will probably be short - Dylan is traveling and won’t be able to attend. The only thing currently on the agenda is an update on our hosting situation. If you have anything else you’d like to discuss, attend the meeting and ask!</p> <p>See you there!</p>
