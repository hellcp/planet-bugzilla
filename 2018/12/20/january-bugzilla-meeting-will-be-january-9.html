<p>Our regular meeting schedule dictates that our meetings are held on the first Wednesday of every month at 21:00 London Time.  Since the first Wednesday of January is the 2nd and a lot of people will still be on vacation then (and we’ll have issues getting resources for the meeting) we’ll be holding our January meeting on January 9th instead.  You can still find all the details at <a href="https://wiki.mozilla.org/Bugzilla:Meetings">https://wiki.mozilla.org/Bugzilla:Meetings</a></p> <p>The Upcoming events in the sidebar here will update to reflect that whenever WordPress’s cache expires.</p>
